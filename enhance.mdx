## Enhancement vs. Upscale

### Enhancement
- **Focus**: Quality improvement at current resolution
- **Benefits**: Better clarity, detail, and overall quality
- **Use When**: Image quality needs improvement without resolution change
- **Processing**: Optimizes existing pixel information

### Upscale  
- **Focus**: Resolution increase with quality improvement
- **Benefits**: Larger size with enhanced detail
- **Use When**: Higher resolution output is needed
- **Processing**: Increases pixel count and enhances details

## Workflow Integration

### Quality Improvement Pipeline
1. Generate initial image
2. Apply any necessary edits (remix, inpaint, etc.)
3. Enhance for improved quality
4. Optional: Upscale for higher resolution

### Professional Workflow
```bash
# Generate base image
POST /v1/tob/diffusion

# Apply enhancements for quality
POST /v1/tob/enhance {"jobId": "base_job", "imageNo": 0}

# Final upscale for print resolution
POST /v1/tob/upscale {"jobId": "enhanced_job", "imageNo": 0, "type": 0}
```

## Best Results Tips

1. **Image Quality**: Works best with reasonably good source images
2. **Content Type**: Particularly effective for:
   - Portraits and faces
   - Natural landscapes
   - Architectural details
   - Fine art and illustrations

3. **Processing Order**: 
   - Apply edits first (remix, inpaint)
   - Then enhance quality
   - Finally upscale if needed

## Common Applications

### Portrait Enhancement
- Improve skin texture and detail
- Enhance eye clarity and definition
- Sharpen hair and fabric details
- Boost overall photographic quality

### Product Photography
- Enhance material textures
- Improve product detail definition
- Boost color accuracy
- Reduce visual artifacts

### Artistic Work
- Sharpen brush stroke details
- Enhance color depth and richness
- Improve overall visual impact
- Refine artistic elements

### Architecture & Design
- Sharpen structural details
- Enhance material appearances
- Improve lighting and shadows
- Clarify design elements

## Performance Notes

- **Processing Time**: Generally faster than upscaling operations
- **Quality Gains**: Noticeable improvement in most images
- **Resource Usage**: Moderate computational requirements
- **Cost Efficiency**: Good value for quality improvement

## Limitations

- **Source Quality**: Results depend on original image quality
- **Enhancement Limits**: Cannot fix fundamental composition issues
- **Artifact Sensitivity**: May emphasize existing artifacts in poor quality images
- **Style Dependency**: Works better with certain artistic styles

## Notes

- Enhancement is typically applied before upscaling for optimal results
- Works well as a quality improvement step in professional workflows
- Particularly effective for images that will be viewed at original resolution
- Can be combined with other operations for comprehensive image improvement
- Processing preserves original resolution while improving quality
