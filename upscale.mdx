| 1 | Creative | More aggressive enhancement with artistic interpretation | v6, niji6, v6.1, v7 |
| 2 | 2x | 2x resolution increase (deprecated) | v5, niji5 |
| 3 | 4x | 4x resolution increase (deprecated) | v5, niji5 |

## Example Requests

### Subtle Upscale
```json
{
  "jobId": "job_12345",
  "imageNo": 0,
  "type": 0
}
```

### Creative Upscale
```json
{
  "jobId": "job_12345",
  "imageNo": 0,
  "type": 1
}
```

    "feeCost": 80,
    "relaxCost": 0
  }
}
```

## Upscale Types Comparison

### Subtle (Type 0)
- **Best For**: Photography, realistic images, preserving original details
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Minimal artistic interpretation
  - Preserves original composition and style
  - Clean, sharp enhancement
  - Suitable for professional use

### Creative (Type 1)
- **Best For**: Artistic images, illustrations, creative projects
- **Characteristics**:
  - Enhanced artistic details
  - More dramatic improvement
  - May add creative interpretation
  - Good for artistic workflows

## Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Cannot re-upscale already upscaled images |
| 401 | Invalid app identifier |
| 402 | Insufficient account balance |
| 403 | Upscale operation not supported for this image type |
| 429 | Maximum concurrent limit reached |
| 500 | Internal server error |

## Use Cases

### Professional Photography
```json
{
  "jobId": "job_portrait",
  "imageNo": 0,
  "type": 0
}
```
*Use subtle upscale for clean, professional results*

### Artistic Illustrations
```json
{
  "jobId": "job_artwork", 
  "imageNo": 0,
  "type": 1
}
```
*Use creative upscale for enhanced artistic detail*

### Print Preparation
```json
{
  "jobId": "job_design",
  "imageNo": 0,
  "type": 0
}
```
*Subtle upscale maintains quality for print reproduction*

## Technical Details

### Resolution Enhancement
- **Input Resolution**: Various (typically 1024x1024 or similar)
- **Output Resolution**: Significantly higher (varies by model)
- **Quality**: Enhanced detail and clarity
- **File Size**: Larger due to increased resolution

### Processing
- **AI Technology**: Advanced neural network upscaling
- **Detail Enhancement**: Intelligent detail reconstruction
- **Noise Reduction**: Automatic cleanup of artifacts
- **Edge Sharpening**: Improved edge definition

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Appropriate Type**: 
   - Subtle for realistic/professional images
   - Creative for artistic/illustrative content

2. **Quality Assessment**: Compare original and upscaled results

3. **Final Step**: Upscale should typically be the final operation in your workflow

4. **Model Compatibility**: Ensure your original image was generated with a supported model

## Limitations

- **Single Use**: Cannot upscale already upscaled images
- **Model Support**: Limited to newer AI models (v6+)
- **Processing Time**: Higher resolution processing takes longer
- **Cost**: Consumes additional credits

## Workflow Integration

### Typical Workflow
1. Generate initial image
2. Apply any edits (remix, inpaint, etc.)
3. Choose best result
4. Upscale for final high-resolution output

### Quality Control
- Review upscaled results for quality improvements
- Compare with original to ensure desired enhancement
- Consider both subtle and creative options for comparison

## Notes

- Upscaling cannot be undone - save original images separately
- Processing time varies based on original image complexity
- Results quality depends on the original image quality
- Some fine details may be enhanced or interpreted differently
- Not compatible with all image generation models
