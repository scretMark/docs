title: "Reroll"
description: "Re-execute tasks to generate new variations"
---

Re-execute an existing image generation task to create new variations using the same prompt and parameters.

## Endpoint

```
POST /v1/tob/reroll
```

## Headers

| Header | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `x-youchuan-secret` | string | Yes | Your Youchuan secret key |
| `x-youchuan-app` | string | Yes | Your Youchuan app identifier |

## Request Body

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `jobId` | string | Yes | ID of the original task to reroll |

## Example Request

```json
{
  "jobId": "job_12345"
}
```

## Response

Returns a [Job object](/api/schemas/job) containing the new task information.

```json
{
  "id": "job_67890",
  "status": 0,
  "text": "A beautiful sunset over mountains with vibrant colors",
  "urls": [],
  "cost": {
    "feeCost": 100,
    "relaxCost": 0
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Original Parameters**: The system retrieves all parameters from the original job
2. **New Seed**: A new random seed is generated for variation
3. **Same Prompt**: The exact same text prompt is used
4. **Fresh Generation**: The AI creates entirely new images based on the original parameters

## Use Cases

### Creative Exploration
- Generate multiple interpretations of the same concept
- Explore different compositions with identical prompts
- Find the best version among several attempts

### Quality Improvement
- Try again if the original results were unsatisfactory
- Get additional options for client presentations
- Overcome temporary AI model inconsistencies

### Batch Creation
- Create series of related images for projects
- Generate multiple versions for A/B testing
- Build image collections with consistent themes

## Example Workflows

### Simple Reroll
```bash
# Original generation
POST /v1/tob/diffusion
{
  "text": "Modern office interior with natural lighting"
}
# Response: {"id": "job_12345", ...}

# Reroll for variations
POST /v1/tob/reroll
{
  "jobId": "job_12345"
}
# Response: {"id": "job_67890", ...}
```

### Multiple Rerolls
```bash
# Generate several variations
POST /v1/tob/reroll {"jobId": "job_12345"}  # Variation 1
POST /v1/tob/reroll {"jobId": "job_12345"}  # Variation 2
POST /v1/tob/reroll {"jobId": "job_12345"}  # Variation 3
```

## Important Notes

- **Identical Parameters**: All original settings (model, aspect ratio, etc.) are preserved
- **New Random Seed**: Each reroll uses a different seed for variation
- **Independent Jobs**: Each reroll creates a separate job with its own ID
- **Cost Accumulation**: Each reroll consumes credits as a new generation task
- **Original Unchanged**: The original job and its results remain unaffected

## Best Practices

1. **Review Original**: Ensure the original prompt and parameters are what you want before rerolling
2. **Budget Consideration**: Multiple rerolls will consume additional credits
3. **Comparison**: Keep track of job IDs to compare results
4. **Timing**: Allow sufficient time between rerolls to avoid rate limiting

## Limitations

- Cannot modify the original prompt or parameters (use remix for prompt changes)
- Each reroll is billed as a separate generation task
- No guarantee that rerolled results will be better than the original
- Some variability is inherent to AI generation, even with identical inputs
